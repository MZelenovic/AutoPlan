# AutoPlan Capi
  Software that facilitates the work planning process in an auto parts factory.
The process of production planning in an auto parts factory is carried out in such
 a way that the planning worker daily reviews the state of available materials and
 demand for certain products in the Capi table, which is updated daily. In this project, 
the data from the Capi table was transferred to the Pandas DataFrame, and by using various 
functions and filtering, a table of products was obtained that should be planned. By using
 this software, the planning process is largely automated.

## Instructions for Use

The software operates in a very simple manner. All that is needed is to export the Capi table 
as an Excel file and load it into the software as such. With one click on RUN, you will obtain 
the autoplan in the form of a separate Excel file.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Load the Capi file into the software in Capi_inicijal file.
